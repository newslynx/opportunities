> A garden of NewsLynx futures. 

Issue tracking and ideas for new Sous Chefs, features and other possibilities. 

See the **[list](https://github.com/newslynx/opportunities/issues)** for ways to contribute or add an idea.

If you're looking to help out, many issues are marked with `small`, `medium` and `large` tags and each should have a **description**, list of **relevant files** and **discussion/tag of scope** (small, medium or large).
